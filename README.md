# Ultrasonic Radar
## Introduction
Implementation of Radar System using Ultrasonic sensor and Arduino
## Components Used
1.HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
2.Servo Motor
3.Arduino UNO
4.Breadboard
##  Procedure
1. Connect Ultrasonic Sensor:
 - Connect VCC to 5V on Arduino
 - Connect GND to GND on Arduino
 - Connect Trig to Pin 8
 - Connect Echo to Pin 11
2. Connect Servo Motor:
 - Connect the Orange Wire to Pin 11
 - Connect the signal wire to Pin 11
3. Write Arduino Code:
 - Use the Arduino IDE to write a program.
 - Include the Servo and Ultrasonic sensor libraries.
 - Code the logic to rotate the servo and measure distance
using the ultrasonic sensor.
4. Implement Radar Logic:
 - Use the ultrasonic sensor to measure distances in a
sweeping motion controlled by the servo.
 - Convert distance measurements into angles for servo
movement.
5. Upload Code:
 - Connect your Arduino to the computer and upload the
code.
6. Power Up:
 - Connect the power source to the Arduino.
